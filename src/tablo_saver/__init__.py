tablo-saver provides tools for rescuing orphaned Tablo recordings.

tablo-saver module provides tools for rescuing recordings from
a (dead?) Tablo 1st-gen thru 3rd-gen device, where the recordings
themselves are still extant on an external drive. Depends on the
Tablo.db file being present and up-to-date on that external drive.
This file is nornally stored internally, and is only backed up to
the external drive when the reset button is pressed. So, if you're
lucky...
